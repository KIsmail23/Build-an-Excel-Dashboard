COFFEE SHOP DASHBOARD

You've recently become a franchise owner at Maven Roasters, a coffee shop
chain with three locations in New York City


To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, you've
collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023.
Your goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise
owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

1. Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis
2. Explore the data with Excel PivotTables
3. Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends


OBJECTIVE 1: PREPARE THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the data. How many transactions were
recorded, over what period of time? What products and product categories were sold?

Add a new column to calculate Revenue (price * quantity)

Add new columns to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date
(BONUS: display them as text (i.e. "Jan", "Feb", "Sun", "Mon"), instead of numerical values)

Add a new column to extract Hour from the transaction time.


OBJECTIVE 2: EXPLORE THE DATA WITH PIVOT TABLES

Insert a PivotTable on a new tab to show revenue by month

Add two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of
week and by hour of day

Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product
category, sorted descending by transactions

Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by
product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions.

OBJECTIVE 3: BUILD A DYNAMIC DASHBOARD

Add Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week
and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart

Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the PivotTable
showing Top 15 product types (you can design your own layout, or follow the solution)

Add a slicer for store location, and connect it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet

Adjust formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard (TIP: hide the raw
PivotTables and remove the worksheet gridlines!)

improve Maven Roasters operations
